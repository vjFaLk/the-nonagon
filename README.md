# The Nonagon

This is a funky looking 8 switch macropad with a rotary encoder in the center. "Inspired" by one of my favourite albums of all time, Nonagon Infinity by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. 

This is still very much in WIP as I've sent it to be fabricated, I'll be designing a 3D printed case for this as well.
